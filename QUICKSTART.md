## 🎨 Example: Using the Store

```typescript
// Add income
export function EmploymentIncomeForm() {
  const addIncome = useStore((state) => state.addIncome);
  const saveToStorage = useStore((state) => state.saveToStorage);
  
  const handleSubmit = async (data) => {
    const income: EmploymentIncome = {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      ownerId: selectedEntityId,
      type: 'employment',
      schedule: '1',
      taxYear: currentTaxYear,
      details: {
        employerName: data.employerName,
        employerTIN: data.employerTIN,
        grossAmount: data.grossRemuneration,
        grossRemuneration: data.grossRemuneration,
        nonCashBenefits: data.nonCashBenefits,
        apitDeducted: data.apitDeducted,
        exemptIncome: 0,
      },
    };
    addIncome(income);
    await saveToStorage(); // Persist to localStorage
  };
  
  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>...</form>
}
```

## 🔐 Security Architecture

- Passphrase is NEVER stored (only its hash for validation)
- All data encrypted before localStorage storage
- Encryption key derived from passphrase via PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations)
- Each save uses new random IV (Initialization Vector)
- localStorage used instead of cookies (larger storage capacity)
- Backup files (.wglk) are fully encrypted and portable

## 💾 Storage & Backup

### localStorage Structure
```
wealthguard_lk_data            → Encrypted AppState
wealthguard_lk_passphrase_hash → Passphrase validation hash
wealthguard_lk_passphrase      → Stored for convenience (optional)
```

### Backup Files (.wglk)
- WealthGuard LK encrypted backup format
- Contains full encrypted AppState
- Requires original passphrase to decrypt
- Can be imported during setup or from settings

## 📊 Tax Calculation Flow

```
User Input (Incomes) 
    ↓
calculateTotalIncome()
    ↓
Apply Reliefs (Personal + Solar)
    ↓
calculateProgressiveTax()
    ↓
Deduct Tax Credits (APIT + WHT)
    ↓
Tax Payable
```

## 🚨 Danger Meter Formula

```
Risk Score = (Assets Acquired This Year + Living Expenses)
           - (Income This Year + New Loans This Year)

Green:  Risk ≤ Rs. 100,000 (Safe)
Yellow: Rs. 100,000 < Risk ≤ Rs. 500,000 (Warning)
Red:    Risk > Rs. 500,000 (Danger - Unexplained Wealth!)
```
